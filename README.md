# Proteus Simulations - Assembly and C Codes

This repository contains assembly and C code snippets for simulating various scenarios in Proteus software. These simulations include a Stop and Go sign, a Click counter, and a Parking Exploder using matrix LEDs.

## Files Included:

1. **Stop and Go Sign (Assembly):**
   - **File:** `StopSign.asm`
   - **Description:** This assembly code simulates a stop-and-go sign using LEDs. It creates a sequence of flashing lights to represent the "stop" and "go" signals.

2. **Click Counter (C):**
   - **File:** `ClickCounter4Digit.c`
   - **Description:** This C code implements a click counter using an 8051 microcontroller. It displays the count on a 7-segment display.

3. **Parking Exploder (Assembly):**
   - **File:** `Explorer.asm`
   - **Description:** This assembly code simulates a parking exploder using LEDs. It creates a pattern to indicate parking spaces.

## Running the Simulations:

### Prerequisites:
- Proteus software installed on your system.

### Steps:
1. Open the Proteus software.
2. Load the respective simulation file (`*.asm` for assembly code, `*.c` for C code) and Proteus files into Proteus.
3. Simulate the circuit to observe the behavior as described in the code comments.

## Notes:
- For the C code, you'll need the Keil compiler to compile and run the code.
- Adjust the simulation parameters as necessary in Proteus for optimal visualization and understanding.
